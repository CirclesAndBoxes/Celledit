Data pack for a minimal cell in Minecraft

Run function: 
* /function celledit:fill/small_cell/initialize

to see the cell in action. Right click to toggle visibilities. 1 second cooldown for clicks

Note: 
* You do have to be within the cell for this to work. This is intentional and can be changed
